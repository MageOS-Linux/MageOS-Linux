# MageOS

MageOS is a Linux distribution built on the philosophy of reliability and stability. By focusing on "tried and true" technologies, MageOS offers a robust environment that favors consistency and predictability over the latest bleeding-edge features. If you want a dependable system—even if some components are a bit older—MageOS is made for you.
